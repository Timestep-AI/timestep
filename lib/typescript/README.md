# TypeScript Library

This directory is reserved for the future TypeScript library implementation.

We intend to abstract a clean, low-level library from the examples in `examples/typescript/` that provides a foundation for building AI Agents using the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) standards.

The library will be extracted from the working examples once the API surface and patterns are well-established.

**Note:** The TypeScript examples are currently pending MCP SDK v2 release (expected Q1 2026). Once v2 is available, we'll complete the examples and then extract the library.
