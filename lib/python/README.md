# Python Library

This directory is reserved for the future Python library implementation.

We intend to abstract a clean, low-level library from the examples in `examples/python/` that provides a foundation for building AI Agents using the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) standards.

The library will be extracted from the working examples once the API surface and patterns are well-established.
